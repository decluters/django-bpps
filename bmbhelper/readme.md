# About This Django App

## How it works

![Bandcamp 2 MusicBrainz helper](./bc2mb.gif)

This application scrapes a Bandcamp album page & outputs scraped data in a MusicBrainz friendly format.
In the future I will try to implement an automatic post to MusicBrainz assuming their API allows it.

## About BandCamp Scraper

This project has a clean and reusable scraper module, check it out at `bmbhelper.utils.bandcamp_parser.py`
Tests for this module are found under `tests.test_utils.py`
